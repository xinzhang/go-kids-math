🧠 一、题型概览

Thinking Skills 通常分为两大类：

1️⃣ Critical Thinking（批判性思维）

要求学生分析论点，判断推理是否合理。

识别论点、结论与证据的关系

判断结论是否合理、是否有逻辑漏洞

识别假设、偏见或错误推理

常见关键词：

“Which statement gives the best reason…”,
“Which of the following most weakens/strengthens the argument?”,
“What assumption is being made?”

2️⃣ Problem Solving（问题解决）

偏向数学逻辑，但不需要正式计算。考查：

图形推理（规律、对称、排列）

排列组合逻辑（时间表、顺序、路线）

数量关系（比例、比较、推算）

常见关键词：

“How many possibilities…”,
“Which option must be true?”,
“If this is the case, what else follows?”

📘 二、示例题目（官方风格）
例题 1：Critical Thinking

A school principal says:
“Students should not be allowed to bring mobile phones to school because they distract from learning.”

Which of the following, if true, weakens the principal’s argument?

A. Some students use phones to cheat in exams.
B. Some students use phones to research information during class.
C. Many students forget to bring their phones.
D. Most students prefer to play games on phones after school.

✅ 答案：B
👉 因为它说明手机可以用于学习，削弱了“手机只会分散注意力”的论点。

例题 2：Problem Solving

Four children — Amy, Ben, Carl, and Dana — are standing in a line.

Amy is not first.

Carl is before Dana.

Ben is after Amy.

Who could be standing third?

A. Amy
B. Ben
C. Carl
D. Dana

✅ 答案：B
👉 合理排列顺序之一是：Carl – Amy – Ben – Dana。

例题 3：Pattern / Logic Puzzle

Find the next figure in the sequence:
■ ▲ ■ ▲ ■ ?

A. ▲
B. ■
C. ■▲
D. ▲■

✅ 答案：▲
👉 因为图形交替出现，遵循“方形–三角形”规律。

例题 4：Quantitative Logic

A train leaves at 8:40 am and travels for 50 minutes.
Another train leaves 15 minutes later and travels for 35 minutes.

Which train arrives first?

A. First train
B. Second train
C. Both at the same time
D. Not enough information

✅ 答案：C
👉 第1列火车：8:40 + 50 min = 9:30
👉 第2列火车：8:55 + 35 min = 9:30 → 同时到达。

🧠 OC Thinking Skills — Practice Test (10 Questions)

Each question has four options (A–D).
Try to answer before reading the explanation.

1. Argument – Weakening

A teacher says,

“Homework should be banned because it causes students to be too tired to learn in class.”

Which of the following weakens the teacher’s argument?

A. Some students do their homework quickly.
B. Some students enjoy doing homework.
C. Homework helps students remember what they learned in class.
D. Students sometimes talk while doing homework.

✅ Answer: C
🧩 Explanation: If homework helps learning, it goes against the claim that homework prevents learning.

2. Logical Order

Four friends — Ella, Max, Noah, and Zoe — are running a race.

Ella finishes before Zoe.

Max finishes before Ella.

Noah finishes after Zoe.

Who finishes first?

A. Ella
B. Max
C. Noah
D. Zoe

✅ Answer: B
🧩 Explanation: Max → Ella → Zoe → Noah.

3. Pattern

Find the next shape:
⬜ ⚫ ⬜ ⚫ ⬜ ⚫ ⬜ ?

A. ⚫
B. ⬜
C. ⚫⬜
D. ⬜⚫

✅ Answer: B
🧩 Explanation: Pattern alternates square–circle; next is ⬜.

4. Critical Thinking

A parent says:

“My child should get a new phone because all her friends have one.”

What is the flaw in this reasoning?

A. It assumes phones are free.
B. It assumes what is true for others must be true for her.
C. It ignores the child’s age.
D. It shows that phones are popular.

✅ Answer: B
🧩 Explanation: “Everyone else has one” is a bandwagon fallacy — it doesn’t justify needing one.

5. Quantitative Reasoning

A bus takes 20 minutes to travel 10 km.
Another bus travels 15 km in 30 minutes.
Which bus is faster?

A. First
B. Second
C. Same speed
D. Not enough information

✅ Answer: C
🧩 Explanation:
First = 0.5 km/min; Second = 0.5 km/min → same speed.

6. Deductive Logic

If all whales are mammals,
and all mammals breathe air,
which statement must be true?

A. All animals that breathe air are whales.
B. Some mammals do not breathe air.
C. All whales breathe air.
D. Whales live on land.

✅ Answer: C
🧩 Explanation: Logical chain: Whales → Mammals → Breathe air.

7. Diagram / Scheduling

Five lessons: English, Maths, Science, Art, PE.

Maths is before Science.

Art is after PE.

English is before Maths.

Which could be the correct order?

A. English, Science, Maths, PE, Art
B. English, Maths, Science, PE, Art
C. Maths, English, Science, PE, Art
D. PE, English, Maths, Science, Art

✅ Answer: B
🧩 Explanation: English < Maths < Science, and PE < Art.

8. Cause and Effect

A student says:

“I failed my test because my pencil was unlucky.”

Why is this reasoning faulty?

A. It blames something that cannot cause failure.
B. The pencil was broken.
C. The test was too hard.
D. The student didn’t study.

✅ Answer: A
🧩 Explanation: This is a false cause fallacy — the pencil cannot logically affect results.

9. Mathematical Logic

Each small box holds 3 apples.
Each large box holds 8 apples.
If there are 4 boxes and a total of 22 apples,
how many large boxes are there?

A. 1
B. 2
C. 3
D. 4

✅ Answer: B
🧩 Explanation:
Let large = x → 8x + 3(4 − x) = 22 → 8x + 12 − 3x = 22 → 5x = 10 → x = 2.

10. Assumption

A coach says:

“Our team will win because we have practiced the most.”

What is the hidden assumption?

A. The other teams didn’t practice at all.
B. Practicing more always leads to winning.
C. The coach is always right.
D. The team is stronger.

✅ Answer: B
🧩 Explanation: The argument assumes that more practice guarantees victory, which may not be true.
